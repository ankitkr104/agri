Title: feat(voice): Add Multilingual Offline Voice Assistant for Farmers (#656)

Related issue: #656

Summary
-------
This PR adds a multilingual, offline-first Voice Assistant feature for the Fasal Saathi platform. The assistant enables farmers to interact using voice (speech-to-text + text-to-speech), supports eight regional languages, includes rule-based offline intent detection, session management, and a React frontend component.

Key changes
-----------
- Add core backend module: `voice_assistant.py` (intent detection, session, offline cache manager)
- Add FastAPI router: `backend/routers/voice_assistant.py` with endpoints under `/api/voice`
- Register voice assistant router and initialize assistant in `main.py`
- Add React component and styles: `frontend/VoiceAssistant.jsx`, `frontend/VoiceAssistant.css`
- Add tests: `test_voice_assistant.py` and examples `voice_assistant_examples.py`
- Add documentation: [VOICE_ASSISTANT_COMBINED.md](VOICE_ASSISTANT_COMBINED.md) (combined docs)
- Update `requirements.txt` with optional/offline-friendly voice deps (pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, vosk, sounddevice, librosa, soundfile, scipy) and cloud fallbacks
- Wire frontend route and navigation link in `frontend/App.jsx`

Why this change
----------------
Farmers need low-friction, accessible ways to use the platform. Voice interaction in regional languages with offline capability reduces friction in low-connectivity areas and supports low-literacy users.

cd agri
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend tests
pytest test_voice_assistant.py -q

# Start backend
python main.py

# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Notes & TODO
------------
- STT/TTS implementations include safe placeholders and instructions to enable `vosk` and `pyttsx3` for offline usage; see `VOICE_ASSISTANT_COMBINED.md` for setup.
- Frontend route was added to `frontend/App.jsx` and the link placed in "More" dropdown. You can add additional links (footer/banner) if desired.
- This PR does not remove the original docs; it adds `VOICE_ASSISTANT_COMBINED.md` as the consolidated reference.
